# Python Package Import Examples

This repository provides a walkthrough of how imports work within Python packages, from basic to more complex scenarios. Each example builds upon the previous one to demonstrate different aspects of Python's import system.

If you want a comprehensive introduction to Python modules and packages, check out [Real Python's guide](https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/).

## Examples

### 01_basic_imports
A simple example showing basic module imports and how to organize code into separate files. This demonstrates the fundamental concepts of Python's import system and how to structure a basic package.

### 02_intermediate_app
A more complex application showing how to structure a package with multiple modules and subpackages. This example demonstrates absolute imports and how to organize code into logical packages with proper separation of concerns.

### 03_import_errors
A collection of common import errors and their solutions. This example helps developers understand what can go wrong with imports and how to fix common issues.

### 04_relative_path_structure
A duplicate of the intermediate app but using relative imports instead of absolute imports. This example demonstrates why relative imports are generally not recommended, especially when it comes to testing, and how they can make code more fragile.

## Getting Started

Each example is self-contained in its own directory with its own README explaining the specific concepts it demonstrates. Start with `01_basic_imports` and work your way through the examples to build your understanding of Python's import system.

## Additional Learning

Want to explore more scenarios or have questions about how imports work? Try:
1. Using a chat-based LLM to ask questions about this repository
2. Using Cursor to create new scenarios and experiment with different import patterns
3. Modifying these examples to test different import scenarios

Remember: The best way to learn is by doing. Don't hesitate to experiment with these examples and create your own variations!
